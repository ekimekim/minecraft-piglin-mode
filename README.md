Datapack that creates a "piglin-mode" game, with gameplay changes:

- Core / challenge changes
  - [ ] Spawn in the Nether
    - [ ] Bonus: keep Nether spawn chunks loaded similarly to vanilla spawn chunks
  - [x] Being in the overworld causes you to take damage
    - This takes the form of nausea + wither status effects. **I highly recommend turning down the nausea effects in accessibility settings**.
    - Because the damage is so slow, it can be effectively combatted by lots of food or other healing
  - [x] Dying in the overworld spawns a zombie piglin
- Quality of life improvements
  - [ ] Piglin aggro is reduced by 1 step (light aggro is removed, medium becomes light, etc)
    - ie. you don't need gold armor, opening chests is ok, breaking chests or gold is still not.
  - [ ] Slime is added to Magma Cube drops
  - [ ] Redstone ore generates in blackstone deposits
  - [ ] Blackstone can be used in place of cobble in more recipes
- Just for fun
  - [ ] Modified Advancements representing the new progression path
